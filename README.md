A simple program just to generate random names for RPG characters.

The idea is to use a list of consonants and another list of vowels and the method random.choice to choose between the elements of the two lists, but first ask to the user to delimit the number of consonants and vowels he wants to the name.

This is the first idea, but I plan to implement the program later; perhaps with Machine Learning - storing the user input data and learning the user's preferences. Or writting a pattern for names such as elf names, dwarf names, vikings names, and so on.

Note: I'm just a begginer and there's a lot to learn here, so if you have any idea to help me implement the program it will be a pleasure of mine to listen to what you have to teach me. I'll aprecciate to much and be so thankfull.
